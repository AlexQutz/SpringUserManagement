# SpringUserManagement
 User Management Full Stack


 As of now i have created a very basic user management system just to understand the structure of a Spring Boot REST API.

 For the HTTP requests i used Postman. 

The app takes a table of users and can implement all the HTTP methods as well as some basic searches.

To see all the users that are currently in the table go to http://localhost:8080/api/users.

To search a user by id go to http://localhost:8080/api/users/byid/{id} where {id} is the value of the user id that you wish to search for.

To search users that have a first name like the one you want go to http://localhost:8080/api/users/byname/{firstname}.


I added some testing to see that all these methods work.


TO BE CONTINUED...

Been experimenting with the Vue framework lately and i am trying to connect it with this Backend to make a full stack app. Maybe add some authentication along the way.
